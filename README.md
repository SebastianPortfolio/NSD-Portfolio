##  Repository Structure

Each project folder includes a combination of the following elements, depending on its scope:

- `README.md`: Project summary and objectives  
- `Project_Overview.pdf` / `.docx`: Written description of approach and findings *(available for most projects)*  
- `Code_Walkthrough.ipynb` / `.Rmd`: Annotated code or analysis notebook  
- `*.csv` / `.xlsx`: Raw or processed datasets  
- `Final_predictions.txt` or visual outputs *(when applicable)*

- *Note that some smaller or exploratory projects may include only essential code and data.*
