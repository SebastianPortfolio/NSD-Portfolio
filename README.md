# Welcome to My Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

Hi there! I'm a data science practitioner with hands-on experience in **machine learning, statistical modeling, optimization, and data analytics**. This GitHub repository showcases a collection of end-to-end projects built in **Python**, **R**, and **SQL**, developed during academic courses and independent study.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Supervised Learning**: Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, LDA/QDA
- **Unsupervised Learning**: K-Means, BIRCH Clustering
- **Optimization & Supply Chain Modeling**
- **Statistical Analysis & Model Selection**
- **Dimensionality Reduction & Bias-Variance Tradeoff**
- **Data Cleaning, Wrangling & Visualization**
- **SQL for Data Structuring and Querying**

## Project Categories

### **Python – Machine Learning**
- `Decision-Tree-Classifier-eBay-Auctions`: Predicting auction success using a tree-based model.
- `Deep_Neural_Network_Income_Levels_Prediction`: Census income classification using DNN.
- `KMeans_and_BIRCH_Clustering_Canadian_Census_Income_Prediction`: Hybrid clustering and classification.
- `KNN_Covid19_Vaccination_Status_Prediction`: Predicting vaccination status from behavioral data.

### **Python – Supply Chain Optimization**
- `Case_Study_Hot_Delivery_Optimization`, `Comfort_Health`, `Ninja_Crush_Saga`, `Athers_Controversy`: Real-world case studies in logistics and operations using Python for decision modeling.

### **R – Predictive Analytics**

## Repository Structure

Each project folder typically contains:
- `README.md`: Project summary and context
- `Project_Overview.pdf` or `.docx`: Written summary of approach and findings
- `Code_Walkthrough.ipynb` / `.Rmd`: Detailed, annotated code
- Raw and cleaned datasets
- Final predictions or visualizations
