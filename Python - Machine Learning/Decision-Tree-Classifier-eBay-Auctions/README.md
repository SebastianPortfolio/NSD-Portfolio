Project Overview: Predicting eBay Auction Competitiveness Using Decision Trees
The primary objective of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether an eBay auction listing is competitive. A competitive auction is defined as one that generates significant bidder engagement. The model leverages decision tree algorithms to provide transparent, interpretable classification rules based on various auction-related features.
