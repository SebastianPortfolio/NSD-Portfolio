Project Overview: Predicting Income Levels Using a Deep Neural Network
The primary goal of this project is to build and optimize a binary classification model to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 annually based on demographic and employment attributes. The model leverages a deep neural network (DNN) architecture built with TensorFlow/Keras and incorporates several stages of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model tuning, and evaluation.
