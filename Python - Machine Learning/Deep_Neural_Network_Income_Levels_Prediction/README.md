# Deep Neural Network â€“ Income Level Prediction

This project builds and evaluates a deep learning model to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K annually using U.S. Census data. It demonstrates a complete pipeline of data preprocessing, neural network training, evaluation, and final prediction deployment.

---

## Objective
Use demographic and employment features to classify income levels using a feedforward neural network (TensorFlow/Keras).

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** U.S. Census Bureau
- **Files:** `USCensusTraining.csv`, `USCensusTest.csv`
- **Target Variable:** `income` (binary: `<=50K` or `>50K`)
- **Features:** Mix of numerical and categorical attributes (e.g., age, education, occupation, native-country)

---

## Key Steps
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and consolidate rare categories
- **Feature Engineering:** One-hot encoding of categorical variables
- **Scaling:** Min-Max normalization of numeric features
- **Balancing:** SMOTE used to address class imbalance
- **Model Architecture:**
  - 2 hidden layers (64 and 32 units)
  - Sigmoid/ReLU activations
  - Binary crossentropy loss
  - RMSprop optimizer
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, confusion matrix, F1-score
- **Tuning:** GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization
- **Deployment:** Final predictions made on processed test data
