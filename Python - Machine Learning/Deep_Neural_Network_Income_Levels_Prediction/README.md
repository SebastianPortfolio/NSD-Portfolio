## Deep Neural Network â€“ Income Level Prediction (U.S. Census)

This project builds and evaluates a deep learning model to classify whether an individual's income exceeds $50K annually using U.S. Census demographic and employment data. It showcases a full machine learning workflow, from preprocessing through model tuning and deployment.

---

### Objective

Classify income level (`>50K` or `<=50K`) using a feedforward neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras, leveraging features like age, education, occupation, and more.

### Dataset

| Dataset Name           | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `USCensusTraining.csv` | Training dataset with demographic and work-related features |
| `USCensusTest.csv`     | Test dataset for final prediction |
| `Final_predictions.txt`| Predicted income labels from the trained model |

**Target Variable**: `income`  
**Feature Types**: Mixed numerical and categorical attributes (e.g., age, education, workclass)

---

### Methodology

#### Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:
- Cleaned missing values and grouped rare categories
- Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables
- Scaled numerical inputs using Min-Max normalization

#### Handling Imbalance:
- Used **SMOTE** to address class imbalance in training data

#### Neural Network Architecture:
- 2 hidden layers: 64 and 32 units with ReLU
- Output layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification
- Optimizer: RMSprop
- Loss Function: Binary crossentropy

#### Evaluation & Tuning:
- Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix
- Performed hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
- Deployed model on unseen test data
