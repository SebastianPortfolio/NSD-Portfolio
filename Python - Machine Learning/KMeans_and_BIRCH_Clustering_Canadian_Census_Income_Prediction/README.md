# KMeans & BIRCH Clustering â€“ Canadian Census Income Prediction

This project applies both **supervised and unsupervised learning** to Canadian census data to **predict median household income** and **cluster geographic regions** with similar socioeconomic traits. The goal is to support urban policy decisions such as housing planning and resource distribution.

---

## Objective
- Predict regional median income using engineered demographic and housing features.
- Segment census tracts using **K-Means** and **BIRCH** clustering to reveal distinct income-related patterns.

---

## Highlights
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Created ratios capturing rental/ownership trends, housing age, dwelling types, and household sizes.
- **Clustering**: Identified optimal cluster count with elbow and silhouette methods. Evaluated consistency using Adjusted Rand Index.
- **Modeling per Cluster**: Trained **Random Forest** and **Decision Tree** models per cluster to capture localized income drivers.

## Techniques Used
- Clustering: K-Means, BIRCH
- Supervised Learning: Random Forest, Decision Tree
- Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, Silhouette Score, ARI
- Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Insight
Older housing, lower ownership rates, and larger households correlate with lower incomes. Segment-specific modeling improves accuracy and interpretability across diverse regions.
