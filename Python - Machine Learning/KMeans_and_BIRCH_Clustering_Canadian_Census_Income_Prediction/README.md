Project Overview: Income Prediction and Clustering of Canadian Census Tracts Using Machine Learning 
The goal of this project is to build a data-driven pipeline that predicts median household income across Canadian census tracts using engineered features derived from housing and demographic census data. Additionally, the project leverages unsupervised learning (clustering) to segment geographic areas into groups with similar socioeconomic characteristics. These insights can guide affordable housing policy, urban planning, and resource allocation.
