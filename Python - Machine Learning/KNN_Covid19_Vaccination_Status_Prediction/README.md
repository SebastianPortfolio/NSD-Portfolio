Project Overview: Predicting COVID-19 Vaccination Status in Canada Using Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a predictive model that classifies individuals' COVID-19 vaccination status using socio-demographic and behavioral features extracted from a Canadian survey dataset. The focus is on distinguishing between "fully vaccinated" and "not fully vaccinated" individuals using a supervised learning approach, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
