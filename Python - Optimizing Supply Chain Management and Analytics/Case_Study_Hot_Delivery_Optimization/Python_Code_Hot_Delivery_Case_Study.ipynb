    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "In this part of the case study, we focus on generating the optimal route for a single driver who starts at a predefined location and must complete a sequence of pickups and drop-offs. The aim is to minimize the total distance traveled while respecting the constraint that each pickup must precede its corresponding drop-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "This foundational model serves as the basis for more complex scenarios involving time and multiple drivers, covered in subsequent parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Assumptions**\n",
    "- One driver starts at a fixed location: *Downtown Toronto (Rosedale)*.\n",
    "- Each order has a pickup (restaurant) and a drop-off (customer).\n",
    "- The driver can carry multiple orders at once.\n",
    "- Each pickup must happen before the corresponding delivery.\n",
    "- The driver finishes their route after the last delivery.\n",

    "# Managerial Questions Answered\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. How does routing logic impact delivery distance?**\n",
    "- Part I focused solely on minimizing distance, yielding a short 33.88 km route. However, it ignored real-world food readiness and delivery urgency.\n",
    "- Time-aware routing (Part II) increased distance to 43.32 km to reduce wait times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. How does time affect customer experience?**\n",
    "- Adding time constraints (Part II) significantly reduced average wait time from potentially unbounded to 17.32 minutes.\n",
    "- The trade-off: greater distance to preserve service quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. What is the value of multiple drivers?**\n",
    "- In Part III, spreading deliveries among 3 drivers improved service efficiency:\n",
    "  - **Avg Wait**: 21.51 minutes (within 30 min limit)\n",
    "  - **Distance**: 49.71 km (reasonable considering 3 separate routes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Operational Takeaways**\n",
    "- Route design must consider both cost (distance) and service (time).\n",
    "- Multi-driver assignment is scalable and supports better balancing of load and customer satisfaction.\n",
    "- Food delivery services should use time-aware routing with multi-agent dispatching to optimize performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This case study reveals that:\n",
    "- Purely distance-based routing (Part I) is unrealistic for modern food delivery services.\n",
    "- Incorporating food readiness and delivery timing (Part II) leads to better customer service, albeit with increased cost.\n",
    "- A multi-driver, time-sensitive assignment and routing strategy (Part III) strikes the best balance between cost efficiency and customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach lays a strong foundation for real-world platforms like Uber Eats or DoorDash to make data-driven routing and dispatching decisions.\n",
