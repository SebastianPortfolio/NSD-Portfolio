Project: Hot Delivery Optimization for Last-Mile Logistics
Objective: To develop a scalable optimization framework for a food delivery platform that improves operational efficiency, reduces delivery distances, and minimizes customer wait times. The project focused on progressively complex routing scenariosâ€”from single-driver routing to multi-driver assignment under time constraints.
