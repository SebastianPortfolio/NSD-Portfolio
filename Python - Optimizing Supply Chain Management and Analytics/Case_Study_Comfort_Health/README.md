# Comfort Health â€“ Medical Supply Distribution Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing the allocation of medical supplies to healthcare centers based on demand and distance. The analysis supports strategic decisions around facility utilization and transportation planning to minimize total distribution cost.

---

## Objective

Determine an optimal distribution plan for Comfort Health that allocates supplies from medical centers to demand sites efficiently while minimizing total transportation distance.

---

## Datasets

- `centers.csv`: Supply availability at distribution centers  
- `demands.csv`: Required demand at various healthcare facilities  
- `distances.csv`: Distance matrix between centers and demand points  

---

## Approach

- **Problem Definition**  
  - Formulated as a **transportation optimization problem** to reduce delivery distances between supply centers and customer locations.

- **Data Preparation**  
  - Cleaned and loaded data
  - Transformed data into long format suitable for modeling.
  - Validated feasibility (total supply â‰¥ total demand).

- **Model Development**  
  - Built a **Linear Programming (LP)** model using the `PuLP` library:
    - **Decision Variables**: Quantities shipped between each center-location pair.
    - **Objective**: Minimize total shipping distance (volume Ã— distance).
    - **Constraints**:
      - Demand at all locations must be fully met.
      - No center exceeds its available supply.

- **Solution & Analysis**  
  - Solved the LP problem to determine the optimal distribution plan.
  - Extracted shipping quantities and analyzed route efficiency and resource allocation.
