Project Overview: ComfortHealth Strategic Workforce Optimization
As part of a strategic planning initiative for ComfortHealth, a Canadian home care agency experiencing increasing demand due to demographic trends and policy support, I developed and implemented a comprehensive optimization model to guide hiring and operational decisions over a three-year horizon (2023â€“2025).
