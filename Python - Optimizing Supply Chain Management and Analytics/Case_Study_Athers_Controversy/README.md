# Athers Controversy â€“ Inventory Allocation Optimization

This project investigates inventory allocation inefficiencies at Athers Inc., using real-world constraints to optimize supply decisions. The analysis explores conflicting stakeholder perspectives, proposes data-driven resolutions, and applies quantitative modeling for actionable insights.

---

## Objective

Diagnose and resolve controversy in inventory allocation between sales and operations teams. Quantify the impact of allocation choices and simulate optimal policies using supply chain data.

---

## Dataset

- `inventory.csv`: Contains sales forecasts, available supply, SKU allocations, and inventory capacities.

---

## Approach

- **Business Understanding**:  
  - Modeled the root of conflict between regional managers and supply chain team.
  - Reframed the issue as a constrained optimization problem.

- **Data Analysis**:  
  - Explored allocation patterns and unmet demand across scenarios.
  - Performed sensitivity analysis on supply caps and demand fulfillment.

- **Optimization Modeling**:  
  - Applied **linear programming** using Python's `PuLP` to re-allocate inventory.
  - Objective: maximize fulfilled demand under supply constraints.

- **Scenario Simulation**:  
  - Compared actual vs. optimized allocations across business units.
  - Visualized trade-offs and identified win-win outcomes.

## Outcomes

- Proposed optimal inventory allocation reduced total unmet demand by **X%**.
- Resolved internal tension by demonstrating fairness across regions.
- Showcased the power of transparent optimization to inform business decisions.
